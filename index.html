      Blåhaj (stylized BLÅHAJ, Swedish pronunciation: [ˈbloːhaj], lit. 'blue shark'; colloquially anglicised as /ˈblɑːhɑːʒ/, /ˈblɑːhɑː/ or /ˈbloʊhaɪ/) is a plush toy manufactured and sold by the Swedish company IKEA. Modeled after a blue shark and made of recycled polyester, the toy has gained prominence on social media as a popular internet meme, especially in the transgender community, and has also been used as a mascot by IKEA in some regions.</p>

      <h2>Physical properties</h2>
      <p>Blåhaj is a 100 cm (39 in) long stuffed toy resembling a blue shark and stuffed with recycled polyester. It can be machine-washed at 40°C (104°F).[1]</p>

      <p>A small, 55 cm (22 in) long variant of the Blåhaj, nicknamed Smölhaj or Smolhaj, is also available.[2]</p>

      <h2>Production and distribution</h2>
      <p>In September 2021, Twitter accounts representing IKEA in Ireland and in Singapore, in response to customers enquiring about the toy, claimed that Blåhaj would be discontinued in April 2022.[3] Sources later confirmed that it had been out of stock or delisted from IKEA's stores in China, Taiwan, and Singapore.[4] However, IKEA's USA Twitter account later stated that the toy would remain available for sale in the United States.[5][3][6] Later, IKEA's Media Relations team clarified that the plush would not be discontinued, but online shop and internal store listings in several countries were simply reflecting a supply chain issue.[citation needed] In early 2022, new Blåhaj plushes were found to have been made in Indonesia, indicating that they had switched suppliers during that period.[citation needed]
